/*! \class Module
 *  \brief The controller module which launches the controller thread.
 *
 *  Basically all this does is parse the command line arguments and look for the various config and task set files. It then instantiates a WBI instance (yarpWBI specifically) and a \ref Thread instance. It launches these threads and then basically just waits till it gets a kill (ctrl+c) command to close them down. Does a little keeping track of time as well.
