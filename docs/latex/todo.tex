Class \hyperlink{classThread}{Thread} ]Remove task sequences. This class sets up an ocra\+::\+Model which is constructed from an Ocra\+Wbi\+Model and an ocra\+::\+Controller which can be specified as either a Wocra\+Controller, a Gocra\+Controller, or a Hocra\+Controller. The thread is looped at the period specified by the user (defaults to 10ms) and on each loop the Model is updated and the control torques are recalculated. {\itshape At the writing of this comment, task sequences are still in use and they too are initialized and updated here. They will be removed eventually.}
